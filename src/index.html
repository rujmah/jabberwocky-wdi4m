    <div class="stanza">

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
<br> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
<br>
      And the mome raths outgrabe. 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">

“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
<br>
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
<br>
      The frumious Bandersnatch!” 
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
<br>
      Long time the manxome foe he sought— 
<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree 
<br>
      And stood awhile in thought. 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">

And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
<br>
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
<br>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
<br>
      And burbled as it came! 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
<br>
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
<br>
He left it dead, and with its head 
<br>
      He went galumphing back. 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">

“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
<br>
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
<br>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” 
<br>
      He chortled in his joy. 
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
<br>
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

All mimsy were the borogoves,
